            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The differently-abled & sexuality</h1><p>Differently- abled' and 'sexuality' are two words that are not used together in our society very often.

You sit down to watch a movie and ask Netflix for help. ("Will I like Birdemic? Ishtar? Zoolander 2?") The Netflix recommendation algorithm predicts what movie you'd like by mining data on millions of previous movie-watchers using sophisticated machine learning tools.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/0ffc632d4edb1d8bd9143ff6c2539368/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fhbr.org%2Fresources%2Fimages%2Farticle_assets%2F2016%2F12%2Fdec16-08-61949289.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Exceptional Lives With Cerebral Palsy: Starring Now</h1><p>Disability is still viewed as a stigma in society. Things are changing with emphasis being given to spreading greater awareness and information, but it's painfully slow and in limited circles. Many people prefer the term 'Differently abled' to 'Disabled', which poignantly describes the difference in perspective that is slowly making its presence felt.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/0a37640240565009d044b7552707d5a1/noop.png?input=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stories.spethe.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F10%2Fb7aa1b3a-2eae-4ad5-b5f5-d3161489eb9e6b89f3eb-d46e-4d2a-a3dc-3d668e238ca3-810x486.png"></article>]]></description>
