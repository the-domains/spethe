  Many individuals who prefer large type, enhanced contrast, or captioning on
  videos do not regard themselves as disabled, yet they benefit tremendously
  from accessible eLearning content; addressing those issues can make using
  eLearning easier, more convenient, and less frustrating. And if eLearning is
  easier to use, learners are likely to be more engaged and willing to complete
  the training.
