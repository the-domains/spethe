  My cousin looked at the sheet and burst into peals of laughter. Actually, I
  was trying to make some portrait and I do admit that it came out no more than
  hideous. But I thought of not giving up. However, after some time, I got bored
  and kept the paint and brush aside and settled down on the couch.
