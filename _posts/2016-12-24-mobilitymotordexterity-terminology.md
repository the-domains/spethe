  The word mobility generally refers to walking or moving about and so the term
  ‘mobility impairment’ may be an inappropriate classification when referring to
  computer use. If the intended classification is meant to refer to a person’s
  ability to use a standard mouse or keyboard, motor or dexterity impairment
  would be a better choice. ‘Motor disability’ and ‘physical disability’ are
  also acceptable terms.


  Wheelchair usage: Use the phrase ‘person who uses a wheelchair’ or ‘wheelchair
  user’ rather than ‘confined to’ or ‘restricted to’ a wheelchair.


  Terms to Avoid:


  restricted to a wheelchair

  confined to a wheelchair

  wheelchair-bound

  deformed

  crippled

  physically challenged
