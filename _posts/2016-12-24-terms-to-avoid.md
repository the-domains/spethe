  The choice of the words for referring to people with a hearing loss will
  depend on many factors. People who use sign language generally refer to
  themselves as deaf. In some cases, the word Deaf is spelled with a capital D
  to refer to members of the Deaf Community [6]. This would be appropriate if
  discussing a cultural issue. The use of deaf with the lower-case spelling more
  typically refers to a hearing loss and is appropriate if cultural issues are
  not part of the discussion topic.

The choice of the words for referring to people with a hearing loss will depend on many factors. People who use sign language generally refer to themselves as deaf. In some cases, the word Deaf is spelled with a capital D to refer to members of the Deaf Community \[6\]. This would be appropriate if discussing a cultural issue. The use of deaf with the lower-case spelling more typically refers to a hearing loss and is appropriate if cultural issues are not part of the discussion topic.

Some deaf people prefer to use sign language; others prefer to rely on spoken language through speech, lipreading, residual hearing, hearing aids, or cochlear implants. Thus, when describing deaf participants it is often crucial to indicate the communication preferred by the individual.

Typically, the term hard of hearing is used to refer to less severe hearing loss than the term deaf. Again, however, this terminology is culturally sensitive and for individuals is determined in many cases by their community identify rather than by the degree of hearing loss.

In writing about participants with a hearing loss, choice of terminology will often be determined by the topic of study.

Hearing impaired is a term typically reserved for medical writing and refers to the decibel-level of hearing. Because it negatively emphasizes a deficiency , the term hearing impaired is typically rejected by members of the Deaf Community. However, elderly people who have experienced hearing loss later in life may prefer the term hearing impaired as they do not identify with the deaf or hard of hearing groups.

As examples, when writing about topics that include sign language or Deaf Culture, use 'deaf' or 'Deaf'. When writing about general accommodation for this group use 'deaf and hard of hearing'. If you are writing about topics that include or are directly dependent on decibel level of hearing, refer to the degree of hearing loss.
