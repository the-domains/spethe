# Vision terminology

### Spethe team

The phrase 'visually impaired' is commonly used. While this is a phrase that is acceptable to most stakeholders, for scientific writing this phrase often does not convey enough information. In writing, it is important to note characteristics of the disabled participants.

For example, in some studies it is critical to know if participants are screen reader users or whether they prefer magnification or visual filters. Not all blind people use screen readers, some people with low vision use screen readers, others use magnification software or other software to help better navigate a visual interface. Make sure that your writing explicitly states any assumptions, for example do not use the term "blind people" when you really mean "people who use screen readers as their primary means of accessing a computer."

In other studies, it may be critical to distinguish participants by degree of vision loss. The terms 'blind', 'legally blind; and 'low vision' are commonly used, but for scientific writing require definition with reference to the research

### Terms to avoid:

* sight deficient
* people with sight problems
* 'unsighted'
