  Disability is still viewed as a stigma in society. Things are changing with
  emphasis being given to spreading greater awareness and information, but it's
  painfully slow and in limited circles. Many people prefer the term
  'Differently abled' to 'Disabled', which poignantly describes the difference
  in perspective that is slowly making its presence felt.
